## Main functions
- [demo_simulation.m](https://github.com/woorimjung/rvcrq/edit/main/demo_simulation.m)
 : Toy example running the proposed method.

- [RVC.m](https://github.com/woorimjung/rvcrq/edit/main/RVC.m)
 : Main ADMM algorithm solving optimization problem.

-[upd_D.m](https://github.com/woorimjung/rvcrq/edit/main/upd_D.m)
 :This function performs the embedded ADMM algorithm to compute the coefficient matrix for principal component functions, serving as a critical component within the iterative update process of the main ADMM algorithm.
